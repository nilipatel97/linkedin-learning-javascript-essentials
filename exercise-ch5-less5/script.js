/**
 * Task: 
 * - use querySelector and querySelectorAll
 * - identify a specific element and get it
 * - target specific elements nested deep inside other elements
 * - use advanced css queries to get just the thing you want
 * 
 * Challenge: 
 * - try populating a variable with an element higher up on the Document
 * = then try using the querySelector method on that element to find one of its children
 * 
 * Reminder:
 * - the query selector uses and reads CSS selectors.
